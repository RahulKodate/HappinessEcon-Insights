<!--![HappinessEcon-Insights Logo](logo.png)-->

Welcome to the HappinessEcon-Insights repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring the economics of happiness and gaining valuable insights from the World Happiness Report and related data. Our aim is to analyze the factors that contribute to happiness, understand the relationship between economic indicators and happiness levels, and uncover meaningful findings about the happiness index across different countries.

## Context 🌞

The World Happiness Report 2022 sheds light on the universal desire for happiness and the capacity of individuals to support each other, even in challenging times. This report, published by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (a global initiative of the United Nations), correlates respondent ratings of their own lives with various quality-of-life factors. Finland has consistently been ranked as the happiest country, while some African countries have faced struggles on the happiness index.

## Objectives 🎯

The objectives of this study are as follows:

- Determine the economic indicators that significantly contribute to the happiness index
- Analyze the alignment between a country's political system and populace in assessing happiness levels
- Explore the reasons behind the challenges faced by African countries and the success stories of certain South Asian countries in improving the happiness index
- Focus on countries with significant positive or negative changes in their happiness index

## Data Frames 📊

We utilize the following data frames for our analysis:

- World Happiness Report 2021
- Democracy-dictatorship index
- Population by country in 2020

## Algorithms 💡

We employ the following algorithms to analyze the data:

- Classification: to classify whether a country is happy or sad
- Regression: to predict the happiness index on a scale of 1-10 and assess happiness levels
- AutoML: to compare and fine-tune predictions generated by regression and classification models
- Algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, xgboost, and more

## Evaluation 📈

Our evaluation process involves the following steps:

- Identify the critical predictor variables and analyze their relationship with happiness
- Compare various models using error metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- Interpret the models to gain insights and understand the accuracy of predictions

## Model Interpretation 🧐

To interpret our models, we consider the following:

- Feature selection based on different models and their relationship with the target variable, i.e., the Happiness index
- Assess feature importance to analyze the accuracy of the model and understand the significant factors impacting happiness
